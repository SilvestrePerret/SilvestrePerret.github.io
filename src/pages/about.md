Hi, I'm Silvestre Perret.

I'm an AI/ML Engineer that loves to build and ship impactful pieces of software. Bonus points if they involve data and machine learning.

Over the years, I've done a broad array of things. Some of which you may expect: analyses of BIG datasets, building multi-model pipelines, running AB tests to measure the impact of new models. Some of which you may not: optimizing SQL databases, devops, C# backend development.

[I'm trying my hand at writing.](/posts)

I'm not bad when working solo but I **thrive** with some emulation from motivated peers. I'm not picky technology-wise as long as the job is properly done. I've done multiple freelance missions and helped startups and SMEs to get their data projects off the ground.

When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking in the mountains, playing chess, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. (I am an original, aren't I?).

I'm always happy to connect with like-minded people, so feel free to [send me an email](mailto:silvestre.perret@gmail.com) or [reach out on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvestreperret/).
